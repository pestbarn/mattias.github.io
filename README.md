This is where you will find the source code for my online resume, located at [mattias.pw](http://www.mattias.pw).

I'm also running a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) page in this repository, holding my [currently ongoing coding projects](http://www.mattias.pw/projects/). Everything else is pretty straight forward. Feel free to have a look around, and if you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me!
