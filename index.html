                <h3>Frontend developer</h3>
                <p>Sportamore is the largest nordic online retailer of sport equipment. The company's goal has from the start been to offer the broadest portfolio of brands, the deepest range of products, as well as to provide nothing but the absolute best customer experience.</p>
                <p>Being part of the rather small development team consisting mostly of backend engineers, my role is to maintain and proactively develop Sportamore's existing e-commerce platform, as well as the internal warehouse management system, content management system, newsletters, and more. The experience of working at a mid-sized, publicly listed company is very rewarding &mdash; especially since I came here directly from a small startup. Lots of room for learning!</p>

                <p>Freespee is an ad tech company facilitating algorithmic &amp; programmatic media buying for businesses whose customers want to talk to someone before they buy. Freespee’s <acronym title="Software as a Service">SaaS</acronym> is used to analyze and link back phone calls coming from online and mobile audiences to where on the web they came from.</p>
                <p>Working closely with backend engineers, frontend engineers, and UX designers, as well as the support team and sales team, my role at Freespee was as educative as it was challenging. Dealing with new engineering challenges every day regarding, among other things, the company website, the product, and the <a href="//support.freespee.com">support platform</a>, all whilst being a part of an expanding startup company, was &mdash; to say the least &mdash; very exciting.</p>

                <p>In my spare time, together with a small crew of only six other people, I partook in the planning, organization, and execution of the independent and non-profit music festival Inbreed Open Air Metal Festival. It took place each year in August, and shown over the years a steady festival attendee growth. As organizer, I was in charge of band booking, and the creation and printing of our official merchandise.</p>
                <p>My role as lead developer and lead graphic designer included the development of the official website, creating and maintaining the brand and logotype, designing t-shirt and poster prints, as well as all the graphics for our social media accounts.</p>

                <p>This page is written and created using the lovely tools and techniques listed below. It's an HTML5 page with CSS3 magic &mdash; no javascript is used, not even for the animations, only to prove that you can go far without it. The CSS is preprocessed with Sass + Compass, and is using a grid written with Susy. All code is forged in Atom and Nano, all graphics assembled in Photoshop, and the entire page was developed using a Git workflow on both Mac OS X and Windows 7/10. Finally, it's hosted over at Github Pages with a <a href="//github.com/pestbarn/pestbarn.github.io/blob/master/LICENSE">CC0 License</a>. The <a href="/projects/">mattias.pw/projects/</a> page is built with and running on Jekyll.</p>

                <p>Head over to my <a href="//github.com/pestbarn/pestbarn.github.io">Github repository</a> if you're interested in looking at the code. And please note that while there is no javascript to be found there, I'm rather well acquainted with it.</p>
